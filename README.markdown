#Getting started with Blitz.CSharp


1. Get an account at [blitz.io](http://blitz.io/). Play around with Blitz using the web interface


2. If you want to work directly with the source, download it from Github. To get started even faster, use the Nuget package. From the [Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console), run "Install-Package Blitz.CSharp"



3. See the [sample code on GitHub](https://github.com/dangerwheeler/Blitz.CSharp/blob/master/Blitz.Console/Program.cs)

Feedback is warmly welcomed.
